## Integration Plan for Catalog Integration 📦

**Process Overview**

1. **Define Catalog Structure** 🏗️
   - Determine the structure of the catalog, including the required fields and their data types.
   - Ensure compatibility with other systems where catalog data will be synchronized.

2. **Function Overriding** 🔄
   - Implement function overriding to extract data from the catalog table and pass it to the MainClass.
   - In the future, aim to streamline this process for even greater efficiency.

3. **Create Subscriber Class** 🧑‍💻
   - Inherit from the `SubscriberBase` class and leverage the `MainClassMeta` metaclass for ease of implementation.
   - Customize the Subscriber class to align with your specific catalog integration requirements.
   - Additional functionality can be added via function overriding as needed.

4. **Set Up Data Synchronization** 🔄🔄
   - Decide on the method for data synchronization between the catalog and external systems (InSync).
   - Consider options like API polling or webhooks based on your system's needs.
   - Implement necessary data validation to prevent errors, duplicates, and infinite loops.

**General Workflow**

1. **Catalog Creation** 🏗️
   - Create the catalog table in your database, defining the fields required for storing catalog data.

2. **Main and Subscriber Classes** 🧑‍🔬🧑‍💼
   - Generate Main and Subscriber classes using templates from the `sync_framework`.
   - Customize these classes to meet the specific requirements of your catalog integration.

3. **Function Overriding** 🔄
   - Override the save and delete methods within your classes to handle customized inward and outward synchronization behavior.

4. **Outward Synchronization** 🔄🌐
   - Implement outward synchronization behavior within your Subscriber class.
   - Define how data should be pushed from your internal system to external systems.

5. **Registration with Main Class** 📊
   - Register your Subscriber class with the Main class to establish the synchronization process.
   - Ensure that data flows seamlessly between the Main and Subscriber classes.

6. **Inward Data Synchronization** 🔄🔗
   - Determine the approach for inward data synchronization, either via API polling or webhooks.
   - Apply rigorous data validation to maintain data integrity and avoid errors.

This structured plan should help you smoothly integrate your catalog into the Syncflow framework. With a well-organized approach and a touch of emojis, you'll be ready to go! 🚀
